### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project is part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree. The objective of the project is to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The source code in this repository is used to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script also takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The following data files were used for this project (not included in this repository due to their size):

- chicago.csv
