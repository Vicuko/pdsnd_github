>**Note**: Please **fork** the current Udacity repository so that you will have a **remote** repository in **your** Github account. Clone the remote repository to your local machine. Later, as a part of the project "Post your Work on Github", you will push your proposed changes to the remote repository in your Github account.

### Requirements/Installation

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

To run this project, you will need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run `bikeshare.py` in a terminal or command window.

Please ensure that you have the necessary data files in the same directory as the script. The data files are: 'chicago.csv', 'new_york_city.csv', 'washington.csv'

### Date created
Project was created on June 25, 2023.

### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project is part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree. The objective of the project is to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The source code in this repository is used to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script also takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
The following data files were used for this project (not included in this repository due to their size):

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

And the following script:

- bikeshare.py : Main script to run this analysis.

### Credits
This project was completed as part of the [Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) program by Udacity.

Additionally, I've found the following resources helpful during the development of this project:

- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

I'd like to thank the mentors and the student community at Udacity for their help and support.
